  <p><span class="bold">IMPORTANT:</span> We need your help - information on manufacturers and radios, schematics, photos... if you have anything to contribute please do.  If you can email it, then send it to the <a href="mailto:admin@essentialtech.co.nz">site admin</a>.  If email is not your thing, feel free to contact Steve direct on 0220 637 600.</p> 
  <p><span class="bold">RECENT UPDATES</span><br>Under the hood, chassis' are now able to be added, then models can connect to a chassis - this saves writing the same information for 2, 3, or more models using the same internals.  Each model in this position now lists other models using its chassis.  See Pacific Elite and Columbus model 12 for examples.</p>

  <a class="non_gallery" title="Golden Age of Radio" href="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"><img class="img_left" src="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"></a><br>Much of this information has come from restorers and collectors - and from the incredible books written by John W.
