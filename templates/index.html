  <p>Welcome to the New Zealand Vintage Radio reference site.  I designed this site to make it easy to find information on (predominantly) NZ valve radios (thats tube radios for our American visitors) , the brands, their manufacturers and distributors.</p>
  <p>Much of this information has come from restorers and collectors - and from the incredible books written by John W. Stokes - The Golden Age of Radio in the Home, and More Golden Age of Radio.
  </p>
  <p>Much could be said of John Stokes, and at some point I will assemble a page of information about him - but there wouldn't be many NZ vintage radio enthusiasts who don't own him a debt of gratitude for his work in preserving the history of NZ radio for future generations.  I was never lucky enough to have met him, but I would not have even known where to start without the <a href="http://nzvrs.pl.net">New Zealand Vintage Radio Society</a> he helped found, his books, countless notes on countless schematics he left about variations found over the years and photographs of rare sets I may never even be lucky enough to see in person.  He was not alone in this work - there are many others who deserve thanks - but he was at the forefront.  Thanks John.
  </p>
  <p>Finally a quick note on images.  I've assembled model photos from many sources - either from other enthusiasts collections, my own collection, or often from Trade Me (NZ's version of eBay).  I believe these images are public domain, however if you find a photo that you took and you want it removed or altered then please contact me and I will do so.
