  <p class="lightred"><span class="bold">IMPORTANT:</span> We need your help - information on manufacturers and radios, schematics, photos... if you have anything to contribute please do.  If you can email it, then send it to the <a href="mailto:admin@essentialtech.co.nz">site admin</a>.  If email is not your thing, feel free to contact Steve direct on 0220 637 600.</p> 
  <p class="lightblue"><span class="bold">RECENT UPDATES</span><br>SEARCH - see the help section, very basic at present<br>CHASSIS SUPPORT - under the hood the site now uses chassis information to simplify models - this makes it easy to manage multiple models with the same chassis (ie Columbus model 12 / Courtenay model 12)</p>
  <p><a class="non_gallery" title="1933 Acme 6V Superhet" href="/static/images/1933%20Acme%206-valve%20Superhet.jpg"><img class="img_right" src="/static/images/1933%20Acme%206-valve%20Superhet.jpg"></a>Welcome to the New Zealand Vintage Radio reference site.  Our mission is to photo-catalogue as many NZ-designed, manufactured and distributed valve radios (<i>thats tube radios for our American visitors</i>) as possible, preserving them for future generations while also providing a handy reference for restorers and enthusiasts.  Alongside this will be the history of those pioneering manufacturers and brands, some of them on the cutting edge of international technological innovation in the radio field.<br>
  <a class="non_gallery" title="Golden Age of Radio" href="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"><img class="img_left" src="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"></a><br>Much of this information has come from restorers and collectors, from the NZVRS, from old periodicals and newspapers (a special thanks to the team behind <a href="https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/">PapersPast</a>) - and from the incredible books written by John W. Stokes - <span class="italic">The Golden Age of Radio in the Home</span> and <span class="italic">More Golden Age of Radio</span>.
  </p>
  <p>A very special thankyou goes to <a href="http://nzvrs.pl.net">the New Zealand Vintage Radio Society</a> who strive to keep the knowledge and passion for these radios alive.  If you're not a member then please consider joining.  Membership has its privileges.

  <p><span class="bold">Finally a quick note on images:</span><br><a class="non_gallery" title="1941 Haywin Broadcaster" href="/static/images/1941%20Haywin%205-valve.jpg"><img class="img_right" src="/static/images/1941%20Haywin%205-valve.jpg"></a>
    Many of our vintage radios are becoming hard to find let alone photograph.  The images on this site have been assembled from various sources including private and public collections, the web, and online auction sites.  It is not our intention to ever 'steal' photos, and is believed that the images used on this site are in the public domain - however if you find a photo that belongs to you then please contact the <a href="mailto:admin@essentialtech.co.nz">site admin</a> for attribution, modification or removal.
