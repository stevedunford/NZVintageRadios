  <p><span class="bold">IMPORTANT:</span> We need your help - information on manufacturers and radios, schematics, photos... if you have anything to contribute please do.  If you can email it, then send it to the <a href="mailto:admin@essentialtech.co.nz">site admin</a>.  If email is not your thing, feel free to contact Steve direct on 0220 637 600.</p> 
  <p><span class="bold">RECENT UPDATES</span><br>On model pages you might find that some valves in the valve lineup section are clickable.  Many common valves now have a quick reference image with at least the pinout which should be useful.  Where possible, equivalent types are in the image title (ie: EL84, when clicked, will show EL84 / 6BQ5 Output Pentode under the image).<br>If you need full data sheets these are available at a multitude of different sources and there's no point reinventing the wheel - a very useful site if you need them is Frank Philipse's <a href="http://www.tubedata.info">tube data</a> site (formerly at frank.pocnet.net).<br><br>
  New Manufacturer page - <b>EXPERIMENTAL!</b> Try <a href="/new/manufacturer">adding a new manufacturer</a> if they're not listed (or even try if they are to see what happens).  Implemented in extremely basic form, but it should work.  <a href="mailto:steve@essentialtech.co.nz">email here</a> if it breaks, or if you've added something you think should be kept (as information may be overwriten accidentally while developing).</p>
  <p><a class="non_gallery" title="1933 Acme 6V Superhet" href="/static/images/1933%20Acme%206-valve%20Superhet.jpg"><img class="img_right" src="/static/images/1933%20Acme%206-valve%20Superhet.jpg"></a>Welcome to the New Zealand Vintage Radio reference site.  Here you will find information on mainly NZ-designed, manufactured and distributed valve radios, otherwise known as tube radios in the US.<br>
  <a class="non_gallery" title="Golden Age of Radio" href="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"><img class="img_left" src="/static/images/publications/gar.jpg"></a><br>Much of this information has come from restorers and collectors - and from the incredible books written by John W.
